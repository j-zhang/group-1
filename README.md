**Weekly Goal:**

*Pluses:*
+ Learning tools that are useful
+ Teaching each other and being collaborative, working as a group
+ Asking for feedback and trying to respond to it
+ Knowledgeable instructors

*Deltas:*
+ Instructions should be more clear for each platform
+ Downloading / installing can be done outside of class
+ Partition more work to be done individual with clear instructions
+ Bring everyone up to speed on GitHub
+ Piazza

**Suggestion:**

[  ] _Instructors decide on goal in mind for next class and tell students what to complete before class (i.e. a homework assignment)_

[  ] _Students will be proactive and communicate with each other through IRC, Piazza, bSpace, and complete tasks before class (and edit documentation as we figure things out) and everyone work collaboratively during class_
